#### language-powerpc-assembly Package

Language support for POWER/ppc/powerpc assembly in Atom.

Heavily borrows from [language-x86](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/language-x86) by [taylorlapeyre](https://github.com/taylorlapeyre/).

Thanks to Ben Stevens for being helpful with regex and Cyril Bur for being helpful with the assembly and what instructions/registers should be separated.

Instructions are taken from what's in binutils.  If there's something missing, please send a PR.
